<h1>Project 1: Chess Agent</h1>

<p>During this project, you will exercise what you have learned about representation and search by creating a simple Chess-playing program.
This project provides a model of the state space of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>, and it is your job to write a
program that explores that space efficiently and decides what moves to make to defeat other programs.</p>
<img src="./Project 1_ Chess Agent_files/chess.png" width="1000px" class="centered">

<p>Before you start, you may want to get familiar with the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>. You do not need to know specific details
or become a skilled Chess player to complete this project, but a high-level understanding of the basic rules of the game may be helpful.
You should also review the readings and lecture notes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Adversarial Search</a> (AIMA sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3).</p>

<h2 id="ChessFramework">Chess Framework</h2>

<p>To use the Chess framework, you either need to download the source and executables or use the <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/index.syl">pre-configured IDE provided by your instructor</a>.</p>

<h3>Source and Executables</h3>

<p>If you are <i>not</i> using the pre-configured IDE, you will need to download the components of the Chess framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/chess.jar">chess.jar</a>: the implementation of the rules of chess and the GUI.</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/agents.zip">agents.zip</a>: six example Chess agents.</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/Random.zip">Random.zip</a>: the source code for the Random agent (optional).</li>
</ul>
<p>Extract <tt>agents.zip</tt> into the same directory as <tt>chess.jar</tt>. It contains 6 <tt>.jar</tt> files which are each Chess-playing programs, or agents.
To see a sample tournament between some of these agents, open a terminal window and execute the following command:</p>
<pre>java -jar chess.jar -g 1 -a agents/random.jar agents/greedy.jar agents/novice.jar
</pre>
<p>This tells the Chess program to run a tournament between three agents: Random, Greedy, and Novice.  Each pair of agents will play 2 games
against one another, one as white and one as black.</p>
<p>A transcript of each game is shown to the right of the board (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Portable Game Notation</a>)
and the final results of the tournament are given once all games have been played.  If you run the command above, Novice should come in first
with 4 points, Greedy second with 1.5 points, and Random last with 0.5 points. 1 point is awarded for a win, and 0.5 points is awarded for a
draw or stalemate.</p>
<p>Include <tt>human.jar</tt> in the list of agents to add a human player. For example, to play 2 games between two human players:</p>
<pre>java -jar chess.jar -g 1 -a agents/human.jar agents/human.jar
</pre>
<p>To play against the Novice agent:</p>
<pre>java -jar chess.jar -g 1 -a agents/human.jar agents/novice.jar
</pre>
<p>If the agents are taking a long time to decide on moves, you can try increasing the amount of memory that the Java virtual machine uses.
The <tt>-Xms</tt> command line argument specifies the minimum amount of memory to use, and the <tt>-Xmx</tt> command line argument specifies the maximum
amount to use.  You can also allocate more space to young generation objects using <tt>-XX:NewSize</tt> command line argument to save on
garbage collection time.  To run the above example with exactly 4 gigabytes of memory, 3 of which are used for new objects:</p>
<pre>java -Xms4g -Xmx4g -XX:NewSize=3g -jar chess.jar -g 2 -a agents/random.jar agents/greedy.jar agents/novice.jar
</pre>

<h3>Pre-Configured IDE</h3>

<p>The Chess framework is included in the <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/index.syl">course programming projects</a>. The relevant projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Example Chess Agent</i>: This is the source code for a Chess agent that chooses moves at random. You may want to rename this project and use it as a basis for your agent.</li>
<li><i>Test Chess Agents</i>: Run <tt>Test.java</tt> to see a full tournament of all agents, including the example agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can comment out lines in <tt>Test.java</tt> to modify which agents participate in the tournament. While you are testing your agent,
you might only want to compete against one agent at a time. Generally, if you can beat Greedy, you can also beat Random, and if you can beat
Novice you can also be Greedy, etc., though it is good idea to run a full tournament before submitting your project.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you rename the Example Chess Agent project to reflect your name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on the project.</li>
<li>Choose <tt>Refactor &gt; Rename</tt></li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Regardless of how you use the framework, the <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc">documentation</a> will be helpful. Some of the more important classes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/Agent.html"><tt>Agent</tt></a>: represents a decisions-maker, which should be able to play as either white or black.</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html"><tt>State</tt></a>: represents a specific moment between moves during a game of Chess. States are the nodes
in the space you will be searching.</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Board.html"><tt>Board</tt></a> and <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Piece.html"><tt>Piece</tt></a>: give details on the position and type
of each piece in the current state.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Assignment">Assignment</h2>

<p>Your assignment is to write your own Chess agent. Do this by creating a <tt>.jar</tt> file which contains (at the top level) any class which is
a subclass of <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/Agent.html"><tt>edu.uky.ai.chess.Agent</tt></a>.  It must override
the <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/Agent.html#chooseMove(edu.uky.ai.chess.state.State)"><tt>chooseMove</tt></a> method.</p>
<p>You <i>must</i> name your agent according to your LinkBlue ID. In the Example Chess Agent project, this means changing the name of the agent
from <tt>"Example"</tt> to your LinkBlue ID in the constructor. My LinkBlue ID is <tt>swa378</tt>, so the constructor for my agent would look like this:</p>
<pre>public ExampleAgent() {
    super("swa378");
}
</pre>
<p>Your agent should explore the state space of Chess and make intelligent decisions about which move to make next. You should start in the
<a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/Agent.html#chooseMove(edu.uky.ai.chess.state.State)"><tt>chooseMove</tt></a> method. This methods takes a
<a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html"><tt>State</tt></a> as input and should return one of its child states (thus indicating which move to make next).</p>
<p>The number of states you may explore is <i>limited to 500,000</i>, and you may not take more than 5 minutes to decide on a move. This means you
need to explore the space as efficiently as possible.  If you exceed the search limit or time limit, your agent will throw an exception
and forfeit the current game. Note that these limitations apply <i>per move</i>, not per game (i.e. you may explore 500k states every time you decide
on a move).</p>
<p>When you have finished your agent, you can export it from the pre-configured IDE as a <tt>.jar</tt> file like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on the project and choose <tt>Export</tt>.</li>
<li>Under the <tt>Java</tt> category, choose <tt>JAR file</tt> and click <tt>Next</tt>.</li>
<li>Expand "Example Chess Agent" and uncheck the box for the "Test Chess Agents" project.
<img src="./Project 1_ Chess Agent_files/uncheck.png" class="centered"></li>
<li>Choose the destination for the exported file, making sure that it is named with your LinkBlue ID and ends in <tt>.jar</tt>.</li>
<li>Click <tt>Finish</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since my LinkBlue ID is <tt>swa378</tt>, the name of my agent's executable will be <tt>swa378.jar</tt>.</p>
<p>You must also submit your source code. From the pre-configured IDE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on the project and choose <tt>Export</tt>.</li>
<li>Under the <tt>General</tt> category, choose <tt>Archive File</tt> and click <tt>Next</tt>.</li>
<li>Choose the destination for the exported file, making sure that it is named with your LinkBlue ID and ends in <tt>.zip</tt>.</li>
<li>Click <tt>Finish</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since my LinkBlue ID is <tt>swa378</tt>, my project source archive name will be <tt>swa378.zip</tt>.</p>
<p>You will need to submit both the agent <tt>jar</tt> file and the source <tt>zip</tt> file on Canvas. If you submit only one, your project will not be graded.</p>

<h2 id="Grading">Grading</h2>

<p>This is how your project will be graded: First, I will download your <tt>jar</tt> file and place it in a directory that matches your LinkBlue ID.
Then I will run the following command, substituting your ID for mine:</p>
<pre>java -Xms4g -Xmx4g -XX:NewSize=3g -jar chess.jar -a swa378/swa378.jar agents/random.jar agents/greedy.jar agents/novice.jar agents/beginner.jar agents/intermediate.jar -g 1 -nl 500000 -tl 300000 -o results.html -b
</pre>
<p>This means that your agent will play in a tournament against the five AI agents I have provided. Your agent will play 2 games against each opponent,
one as white and one as black.</p>
<p>Agents are ranked according to these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The agent with more points is ranked higher.</li>
<li>In case of a tie, the agent that made fewer total moves is ranked higher.</li>
<li>In case of a further tie, the agent that explored fewer total <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html">states</a> is ranked higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your grade will be determined by your score in the tournament:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Your agent...</th><th>Undergraduate Grade</th><th>Honors/Graduate Grade</th></tr>
<tr><td>Beats Intermediate</td><td>A (105%)</td><td>A (100%)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beats Beginner</td><td>A (100%)</td><td>B (80%)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beats Novice</td><td>B (80%)</td><td>C (70%)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beats Greedy</td><td>C (70%)</td><td>D (60%)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beats Random</td><td>D (60%)</td><td>E (50%)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Compiles and runs without crashing</td><td>E (50%)</td><td>E (0%)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Please observe the following requirements when submitting your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit your project on Canvas by the deadline.</li>
<li>Submit your <tt>jar</tt> file, named for your LinkBlue ID (e.g. <tt>swa378.jar</tt>).
If your agent does not load correctly or throws an exception during play, you will receive an E for this project.</li>
<li>Submit the source code for your agent as a <tt>zip</tt> archive.  It must be named for your LinkBlue ID (e.g. <tt>swa378.zip</tt>).
If I cannot open and read your source code, it will not be graded.</li>
<li>You must perform your search by expanding and searching the provided <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html">state</a>
objects. Do not circumvent the 500,000 node search limit or 5 minute time limit by, for example, creating your own <tt>State</tt> class which
does not obey the limit, or by using Java reflection to override the limit. Circumventing the node limit will be considered cheating.
(Note: it is very difficult to do this on accident, so unless you're explicitly trying to break this rule, you probably won't.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="AbouttheAgents">About the Agents</h2>

<p>Here is some information about your opponents which you may find helpful when designing your agent:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Random</i> chooses moves at random. The random number generator always starts with the same seed, so all else being equal, Random will make the same moves every time.</li>
<li><i>Greedy</i> always chooses the move which maximizes its total <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value">material</a> score.
If it has multiple moves that result in the same score, it chooses at random between them.</li>
<li><i>Novice</i> uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">MinMax search</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">Alpha Beta Pruning</a>
to look 1 turn ahead (i.e. 2 ply or 1 move for each player) and choose the move which will maximize its material score.</li>
<li><i>Beginner</i> uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search">iterative deepening</a> MinMax search with Alpha Beta Pruning
to look 2 turns (i.e. 4 ply) ahead and choose the move which will maximize its material score.</li>
<li><i>Intermediate</i> uses iterative deepening MinMax search with Alpha Beta Pruning to look 3 turns ahead (when possible).
Its search is also <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Quiescence_Search">quiescent</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ClassTournament">Class Tournament</h2>

<p>Every agent which runs without throwing an exception will be entered into a class-wide Chess tournament (2 games between each pair of agents).
The first, second, and third place winners of this tournament will receive bonus points on this project.</p>

<h2 id="HelpandHints">Help and Hints</h2>


<h3>Help! I don't know where to start!</h3>

<p>I recommend that you tackle this project in parts rather than trying to start by writing an agent that beats Intermediate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by writing your utility function. Then write an agent that enumerates all the possible next moves it can make and, if playing
white, chooses the highest utility, and if playing black, chooses the lowest. This agent should be able to beat Random.</li>
<li>Once you're confident your utility function is working, implement MinMax search (without Alpha Beta pruning) with a max depth of 2
(i.e. look 2 moves ahead). This agent should beat Greedy.</li>
<li>Once that's working, implement an agent that first looks 2 moves ahead (like above) and then, if it has budget leftover, looks 4
moves ahead. This agent should beat Novice.</li>
<li>Once that's working, add Alpha Beta pruning to your implementation. It should make exactly the same moves, but faster.</li>
<li>Once you're confident MinMax with Alpha Beta is working, implement iterative deepening. This agent should beat Beginner.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running the tournament takes forever!</h3>

<p>Intermediate Bot takes the longest to decide on its moves.</p>
<p>You can run the tournament from <tt>Test.java</tt> in the "Test Chess Agents" project. In <tt>Test.java</tt>, you can comment out Intermediate Bot to
prevent it from playing in the tournament. Be sure to put it back in when you run your final tests, but while you are working you can play
a much faster tournament by temporarily removing that agent.</p>

<h3>How can I find out how many pieces of what type are on the board?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Board.html">board</a> object implements <tt>Iterable&lt;<a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Piece.html">Piece</a>&gt;</tt>. This means you can treat
a board like a list of piece objects. You can use the Java <tt>instanceof</tt> keyword to find out if each piece is a <tt>King</tt>, <tt>Queen</tt>, <tt>Rook</tt>, etc.</p>
<p>Here are two functions that might be helpful if you want to calculate material score:</p>
<pre>private static int material(Board board, Player player) {
	int material = 0;
	for(Piece piece : board)
		if(piece.player == player)
			material += value(piece);
	return material;
}
</pre>
<pre>private static int value(Piece piece) {
	if(piece instanceof Pawn)
		return 1;
	else if(piece instanceof Knight)
		return 3;
	else if(piece instanceof Bishop)
		return 3;
	else if(piece instanceof Rook)
		return 5;
	else if(piece instanceof Queen)
		return 9;
	// The piece must be a King.
	else
		return 100;
}
</pre>

<h3>Don't compare strings in Java using the double equal sign.</h3>

<p>In Java, the <tt>==</tt> operator (double equal sign) compares whether two things are exactly the same. It is possible for two strings to be different
objects even when they have the same letters. If that happens, <tt>==</tt> will return <tt>false</tt>.</p>
<pre>// This is incorrect.
if(board.player.toString() == "WHITE")
	return "I am playing as white!";
</pre>
<p>The above code actually does work in some cases because of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interning-of-string/">string internament in the Java compiler</a>, but
it's a bad habbit to get into, especially when dealing with non-string objects.</p>
<p>To compare two objects, you need to use <tt>Object#equals(Object)</tt>.</p>
<pre>// This is correct.
if(board.player.toString().equals("WHITE"))
	return "I am playing as white!";
</pre>
<p>In this particular case, there is an even better way to make the comparison. The <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Player.html">Player</a></tt> enum defines two constants,
<tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Player.html#WHITE">Player.WHITE</a></tt> and <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Player.html#BLACK">Player.BLACK</a></tt>. You can always safely compare
these objects using the double equal sign.</p>
<pre>// This is best.
if(board.player == Player.WHITE)
	return "I am playing as white!";
</pre>

<h3>How can I return multiple things from a method?</h3>

<p>Methods in Java can only return one thing, but that one thing can be an object with multiple fields. For example, you might find a class like this helpful.
The code needs to be in a new <tt>Result.java</tt> file in your project:</p>
<pre>import edu.uky.ai.chess.state.State;

public class Result {

	public State state;
	public double value;

	public Result(State state, double value) {
		this.state = state;
		this.value = value;
	}
}
</pre>
<p>You can use the new class like this:</p>
<pre>// A dummy method to demonstrate how to use the Result object.
public Result returnTwoThings(State current) {
	return new Result(current, 0.0);
}
</pre>

<h3>I'm getting an error that says "Invalid move: XXX (not a child of the current state)."</h3>

<p>Your <tt>chooseMove</tt> method needs to return a child of the state that it was given, which represents the move the agent is making.</p>
<p>The most common cause of this problem is that you are doing some form of MinMax search and returning a leaf node at the bottom of the tree, rather than the
move that will (hopefully) lead to that leaf. You might be looking 4 moves ahead, but you can't return a state that is 4 moves ahead; you need to return a
state that is 1 move ahead. If this if your problem, you can simply walk back up the tree using <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html#previous">State.previous</a></tt>
until you find a state whose previous state is current state.</p>

<h3>My agent won't end the game, even when there's a clear opportunity to checkmate!</h3>

<p>Assuming you are using some variation of MinMax search, you need to make sure that your utility function accounts for games that are over. If your utility
function is, for example, just material score, then your agent won't want to end the game because it might have a chance to get more material! Why checkmate
when you have the chance to promote a pawn to a Queen?</p>
<p>There are 4 possible cases that your utility function needs to handle. The first 3 are cases where the game is over (i.e.
<tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html#outcome">State.outcome</a></tt> is not <tt>null</tt>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: The game is a draw or stalemate, either because 100 moves have been made without a piece getting captured or because the same state was repeated 3
times. The game is a draw when <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html#outcome">State.outcome</a></tt> is <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Outcome.html#DRAW">DRAW</a></tt>.
A draw usually has a utility of 0.</li>
<li>Case 2: White has checkmated Black and won the game. This occurs when <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html#outcome">State.outcome</a></tt> is
<tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Outcome.html#WHITE_WINS">WHITE_WINS</a></tt>. This state is the best possible outcome for White, so be sure to return a value accordingly.</li>
<li>Case 3: Black has checkmated White and won the game. This occurs when <tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html#outcome">State.outcome</a></tt> is
<tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/Outcome.html#BLACK_WINS">BLACK_WINS</a></tt>. This state is the best possible outcome for Black, so be sure to return a value accordingly.</li>
<li>Case 4: The game is not over. This is when you should return a number based on your utility function, such as material score.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your utility function is working properly, but your agents still take a long time to win, the problem could be that your agent does not pay attention
to how far away the end of the game is. Assuming you are using material score as your utility function, MinMax thinks that a checkmate that is 3 moves away
is equally as good as a checkmate that is 1 move away, but clearly we should prefer to checkmate sooner rather than later. When deciding which move is "best"
you might want to add a tie breaker: when two moves have the same utility, prefer the one that is fewer moves away. You can do this easily by looking at the
<tt><a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~sgware/courses/cs463g/projects/chess/doc/edu/uky/ai/chess/state/State.html#turn">State.turn</a></tt> counter.</p>

<h3>My agent is making really bad moves!</h3>

<p>There are many reasons why this could be happening, but here are two that I see frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you can play as both White and Black. In a typical MinMax implementation, White tries to get the highest utility score and Black tries to get
the lowest utility score. If your agent always tries to get the highest utility score, when it plays as Black, it will make the worst possible move!</li>
<li>Don't trust the result of a MinMax search if it didn't finish. If your agent ran out of resources in the middle of doing a MinMax search
(even if you are using Alpha-Beta pruning), you can't necessarily trust the result it gave you. You can only trust the result if the search finished. This is
why my agents use iterative deepening--to ensure that the first search will finish before trying a deeper search.</li>
</ul>
